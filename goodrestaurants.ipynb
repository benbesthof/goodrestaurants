        "This research investigates the complex interactions of economic, demographic, and culinary variables in the New York Tri-State region. We use Yelp data and Census information to unearth the stories behind the restaurants in the area because we are curious in how different cultures and economic levels affect dining preferences. Our study questions explore the following topics: how geography affects Yelp reviews; how economic status and restaurant kinds are correlated; how demographic considerations affect restaurant success; where are the best places for new businesses to open; and how popularity, pricing, and ratings relate to each other.\n",

        "Using the Yelp API for restaurant details and Census.gov for demographic and economic data, the process entails a thorough collection of data. Our group works together to do univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses using Python modules such as Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal of the investigative analysis is to discover economic elements influencing culinary preferences, provide recommendations for aspiring restaurateurs based on current trends, and shed light on the relationship between restaurant ratings and demographic composition.\n",

This project exemplifies how to combine extensive data sources with Python's analytical powers to unravel the complexity of the regional food scene."
